### DHGS: Decoupled Hybrid Gaussian Splatting for Driving Scene

Existing Gaussian splatting methods struggle to achieve satisfactory novel view synthesis in driving scenes due to the lack of crafty design and geometric constraints of related elements. This paper introduces a novel method called Decoupled Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (DHGS), which aims at promoting the rendering quality of novel view synthesis for driving scenes. The novelty of this work lies in the decoupled and hybrid pixel-level blender for road and non-road layers, without conventional unified differentiable rendering logic for the entire scene, meanwhile maintaining consistent and continuous superimposition through the proposed depth-ordered rendering strategy. Beyond that, an implicit road representation comprised of Signed Distance Field (SDF) is trained to supervise the road surface with subtle geometric attributes. Accompanied by the use of auxiliary transmittance loss and consistency loss, novel images with imperceptible boundary and elevated fidelity are ultimately obtained. Substantial experiments on Waymo dataset prove that DHGS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

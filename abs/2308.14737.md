### Flexible Techniques for Differentiable Rendering with 3D Gaussians

Fast, reliable shape reconstruction is an essential ingredient in many computer vision applications. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that photorealistic novel view synthesis is within reach, but was gated by performance requirements for fast reconstruction of real scenes and objects. Several recent approaches have built on alternative shape representations, in particular, 3D Gaussians. We develop extensions to these renderers, such as integrating differentiable optical flow, exporting watertight meshes and rendering per-ray normals. Additionally, we show how two of the recent methods are interoperable with each other. These reconstructions are quick, robust, and easily performed on GPU or CPU.

快速、可靠的形状重建是许多计算机视觉应用中的重要组成部分。神经辐射场表明，真实感的新视角合成是可行的，但其性能要求限制了对真实场景和物体的快速重建。最近几种方法基于替代形状表示，特别是3D高斯分布。我们对这些渲染器进行了扩展，例如集成了可微光流、导出密闭网格和渲染每条光线的法线。此外，我们展示了最近的两种方法如何相互兼容。这些重建快速、稳健，且可以轻松地在GPU或CPU上执行。

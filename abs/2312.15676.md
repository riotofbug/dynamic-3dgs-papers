### Sparse-view CT Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Volumetric Representation

Sparse-view CT is a promising strategy for reducing the radiation dose of traditional CT scans, but reconstructing high-quality images from incomplete and noisy data is challenging. Recently, 3D Gaussian has been applied to model complex natural scenes, demonstrating fast convergence and better rendering of novel views compared to implicit neural representations (INRs). Taking inspiration from the successful application of 3D Gaussians in natural scene modeling and novel view synthesis, we investigate their potential for sparse-view CT reconstruction. We leverage prior information from the filtered-backprojection reconstructed image to initialize the Gaussians; and update their parameters via comparing difference in the projection space. Performance is further enhanced by adaptive density control. Compared to INRs, 3D Gaussians benefit more from prior information to explicitly bypass learning in void spaces and allocate the capacity efficiently, accelerating convergence. 3D Gaussians also efficiently learn high-frequency details. Trained in a self-supervised manner, 3D Gaussians avoid the need for large-scale paired data. Our experiments on the AAPM-Mayo dataset demonstrate that 3D Gaussians can provide superior performance compared to INR-based methods.

稀疏视图CT（计算机断层扫描）是一种减少传统CT扫描辐射剂量的有前景策略，但从不完整和噪声数据中重建高质量图像是具有挑战性的。最近，3D高斯模型已经被应用于复杂自然场景建模，与隐式神经表示（INRs）相比，展示出快速收敛和更好的新视角渲染。受3D高斯在自然场景建模和新视角合成应用成功的启发，我们研究了它们在稀疏视图CT重建中的潜力。我们利用过滤反投影重建图像中的先验信息来初始化高斯模型；并通过比较投影空间中的差异来更新它们的参数。通过自适应密度控制进一步提高性能。与INRs相比，3D高斯更能从先验信息中受益，明确地绕过在空白空间的学习，并高效地分配容量，加速收敛。3D高斯还能有效地学习高频细节。采用自我监督的方式训练，3D高斯避免了对大规模配对数据的需求。我们在AAPM-Mayo数据集上的实验表明，与基于INR的方法相比，3D高斯可以提供更优越的性能。

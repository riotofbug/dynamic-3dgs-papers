### 2D-Guided 3D Gaussian Segmentation

Recently, 3D Gaussian, as an explicit 3D representation method, has demonstrated strong competitiveness over NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) in terms of expressing complex scenes and training duration. These advantages signal a wide range of applications for 3D Gaussians in 3D understanding and editing. Meanwhile, the segmentation of 3D Gaussians is still in its infancy. The existing segmentation methods are not only cumbersome but also incapable of segmenting multiple objects simultaneously in a short amount of time. In response, this paper introduces a 3D Gaussian segmentation method implemented with 2D segmentation as supervision. This approach uses input 2D segmentation maps to guide the learning of the added 3D Gaussian semantic information, while nearest neighbor clustering and statistical filtering refine the segmentation results. Experiments show that our concise method can achieve comparable performances on mIOU and mAcc for multi-object segmentation as previous single-object segmentation methods.

最近，作为一种显式的3D表征方法，3D高斯在表达复杂场景和训练时长方面展现出了相对于神经辐射场（NeRF）的强大竞争力。这些优势预示着3D高斯在3D理解和编辑方面的广泛应用潜力。同时，3D高斯的分割还处于初级阶段。现有的分割方法不仅繁琐，而且无法在短时间内同时分割多个对象。为此，本文介绍了一种用2D分割作为监督的3D高斯分割方法。这种方法使用输入的2D分割图来指导增加的3D高斯语义信息的学习，同时最近邻聚类和统计过滤用于精炼分割结果。实验表明，我们这种简洁的方法在多对象分割的平均交并比（mIOU）和平均准确度（mAcc）上能够达到与之前单对象分割方法相当的性能。

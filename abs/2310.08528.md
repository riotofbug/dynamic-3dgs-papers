### 4D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering

Representing and rendering dynamic scenes has been an important but challenging task. Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to guarantee. To achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency, we propose 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) as a holistic representation for dynamic scenes rather than applying 3D-GS for each individual frame. In 4D-GS, a novel explicit representation containing both 3D Gaussians and 4D neural voxels is proposed. A decomposed neural voxel encoding algorithm inspired by HexPlane is proposed to efficiently build Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels and then a lightweight MLP is applied to predict Gaussian deformations at novel timestamps. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions, 82 FPS at an 800×800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU while maintaining comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.

表示和渲染动态场景一直是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务。特别是，要准确地模拟复杂的运动，通常很难保证高效率。为了实现实时动态场景渲染，同时享有高训练和存储效率，我们提出了4D高斯溅射（4D-GS）作为动态场景的整体表示，而不是为每个单独的帧应用3D-GS。在4D-GS中，提出了一个包含3D高斯和4D神经体素的新型显式表示。我们受到HexPlane启发，提出了一个分解的神经体素编码算法，以有效地从4D神经体素构建高斯特征，然后应用轻量级的多层感知器（MLP）来预测新时间戳的高斯变形。我们的4D-GS方法在高分辨率下实现了实时渲染，在RTX 3090 GPU上以800×800分辨率达到82 FPS，同时保持与之前最先进方法相当或更好的质量。
